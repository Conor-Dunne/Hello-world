# Hello-world
My first step into Github. 

HI

My name is Conor and I've recently begun the journey of self-taught coding. I've been learning all about HTML, CSS, and Javascript over the past couple of weeks , mainly through codecademy and Khanacademy. I find the access to online education resources and the community support available in the programmming world astonishing. I want get invloved as soon as possible here on Github and learn by doing!
